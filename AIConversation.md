This is duplicate like this, let's refactor getting the default path into a separate function which can be then used by both `get_auto_db_path` and `get_auto_base_path`.

## AI:

You're right, there's duplication in the code for getting the default path. Let's refactor this into a separate function that can be used by both `get_auto_db_path` and `get_auto_base_path`. Here's how we can do it:

1. First, let's create a new function called `get_cursor_workspace_path`:

```python
def get_cursor_workspace_path() -> Path:
    system = platform.system()
    home = Path.home()

    if system == "Windows":
        base_path = Path(os.environ.get("APPDATA")) / "Cursor" / "User" / "workspaceStorage"
    elif system == "Darwin":  # macOS
        base_path = home / "Library" / "Application Support" / "Cursor" / "User" / "workspaceStorage"
    elif system == "Linux":
        base_path = home / ".config" / "Cursor" / "User" / "workspaceStorage"
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported operating system: {system}")

    if not base_path.exists():
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Cursor workspace storage directory not found: {base_path}")

    return base_path
```

2. Now, let's update the `get_auto_db_path` function:

```python
def get_auto_db_path(latest: bool) -> str:
    base_path = get_cursor_workspace_path()

    if latest:
        workspace_folder = max(base_path.glob("*"), key=os.path.getmtime)
    else:
        workspace_folders = list(base_path.glob("*"))
        if not workspace_folders:
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"No workspace folders found in {base_path}")
        workspace_folder = workspace_folders[0]

    db_path = workspace_folder / "state.vscdb"
    if not db_path.exists():
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"state.vscdb not found in {workspace_folder}")

    return str(db_path)
```

3. And update the `get_auto_base_path` function:

```python
def get_auto_base_path() -> str:
    return str(get_cursor_workspace_path())
```

4. Finally, we need to update the imports at the top of the file to ensure we have all the necessary modules:

```python
import os
import sys
import typer
from src.vscdb import VSCDBQuery
from src.export import ChatExporter, MarkdownChatFormatter, MarkdownFileSaver
from rich.console import Console
from rich.markdown import Markdown
from loguru import logger
import json
import platform
from pathlib import Path
```

These changes will remove the duplication and make the code more maintainable. The `get_cursor_workspace_path` function can now be used by both `get_auto_db_path` and `get_auto_base_path`, reducing redundancy and improving consistency.

## User:

Are README.md aware about this change?

## AI:

I've reviewed the README.md file, and it appears that the changes we made to refactor the `get_cursor_workspace_path()` function and update the `get_auto_db_path()` and `get_auto_base_path()` functions are not reflected in the README.md. The README.md is still up-to-date regarding the usage of the tool, but it doesn't mention the internal code changes.

Since these changes are internal and don't affect the user interface or usage of the tool, there's no immediate need to update the README.md. However, if you want to keep the documentation comprehensive, you might consider adding a brief note about the code structure in a "Development" or "Code Structure" section.

Here's a suggestion for a small addition to the README.md, which you could place after the "Usage" section:

```markdown
## Code Structure

The main functionality is implemented in `chat.py`, which includes:

- `get_cursor_workspace_path()`: Determines the Cursor workspace storage path based on the operating system.
- `get_auto_db_path()`: Finds the appropriate `state.vscdb` file in the workspace.
- `get_auto_base_path()`: Returns the base path for the Cursor workspace storage.

These functions work together to provide the auto-detection feature for Cursor workspaces across different operating systems.
```

To reference the README.md content, here are the line numbers:


```1:65:README.md
# Cursor Chat Export

This project provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool to discover and export AI chat data from [Cursor](https://cursor.sh). The tool is implemented in `chat.py` and leverages utility classes for querying the database, formatting the chat data, and saving it to files.

Cursor's chat history is stored in `sqlite3` databases using `state.vscdb` files. One such file is for one workspace. All the chats for a workspace are saved here in so called *tabs*, one tab means a single chat.

Also see [this](https://forum.cursor.com/t/guide-5-steps-exporting-chats-prompts-from-cursor/2825) forum post on this topic.

## Features

- **Discover Chats**: Discover all `state.vscdb` files in a directory and print a few lines of dialogue so one can identify which is the workspace (chat) one is searching for. It's also possible to filter by text.
- **Export Chats**: Export chats data for a certain workspace to Markdown files or print it to the command line.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/somogyijanos/cursor-chat-export.git
    cd cursor-chat-export
    ```
```


This addition would provide a brief overview of the internal structure without going into too much detail, which is appropriate for most users of the tool.
